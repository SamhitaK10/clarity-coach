# Interview Coaching API — Project Scope

Only reference and modify files inside the **interview-coaching-api** folder.

- Read, edit, and suggest code only from `interview-coaching-api/` (server, routes, config, README).
- Do not reference, open, or depend on any files or folders outside this project.
- Assume the only relevant codebase is this Express backend (transcribe, analyze, voice-feedback).
